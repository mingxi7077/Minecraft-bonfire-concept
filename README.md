# Minecraft-bonfire-concept

A small team from China inspired to produce a high-quality player game content from Minecraft, including a mod server; Plugin server; Client Material Pack; Animated shorts and group players in various gameplay styles [e.g. focus on PVP or pastoral survival]. At the moment, the main productivity is for me alone, although the progress is very slow, but it is guaranteed that it will not stop.
